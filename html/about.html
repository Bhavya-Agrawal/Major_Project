There is a lot of benefit for the business looking for the cloud service from the cloud provider. Apart from the bundle of suits they have to offer, it focus all an escape from huge investment from IT infrastructure and operating cost.
	This project report is entitled to a study on Cloud computing and services. The main objective of the study is to provide all the cloud based services.

	<h3>The various services provided in this Cloud Services are:</h3>
	<h2>SAAS (Software as a Service):</h2> 
	It is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet.
<h2>PAAS (Platform as a Service):</h2>
 It is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
<h2>IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service): </h2>
It is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In our application it is provided via launching and running instances.

<h3>SCOPE</h3>
Cloud computing comes into focus only when we think about what IT always needs: a way to increase capacity or add capabilities on the fly without investing in
 new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. Cloud computing encompasses any subscription - based or pay per-use service that, in 
 real time over the Internet, extends IT's existing capabilities.
The aim of the Cloud Computing Interface is the development of an open specification and API for cloud offerings. The focus was on Infrastructure-as-a-Service
 (IaaS) based offerings but the interface can be extended to support Storage as a Service offering as well.
This project is intended for making use of today’s popular technology Cloud Computing for Integrated Development Environment. Currently, there are lots of IDE
s, both open-source and commercial, in the market. Usually they provide lots of extensive features to developers to ease application developer life. 
However, there are two simple but substantial problems with today’s IDEs. First is they require intensive CPU and memory usage which is not available all the
 time and since these applications are installed on specific system, it prevents portability. By combining Cloud Computing technology, this project will 
 remove the requirement for powerful systems and provide portability to developer.
