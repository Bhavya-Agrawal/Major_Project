					<h1><b>Types of Cloud Computing Services</b></h1>
					
					<h3>Infrastructure as a Service </h3>
					<p>
					 or IaaS, gives business access to vital web architecture, such as storage space, servers, and connections, without the
					business need of purchasing and managing this internet infrastructure themselves. Because of the economies of scale and specialization involved, 
					this can be to the benefit of both the business providing the infrastructure and the one using it. 
					</p>

		 

					<h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3> 
					<p>
					clouds are created, many times inside IaaS Clouds by specialists to render the scalability and deployment of any
					application trivial and to help make your expenses scalable and predictable. Some examples of a PaaS system include: Mosso, Google App Engine, and 
					Force.com.
					</p>
		 

					<h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
					<p>
					is relatively mature, and the phraseâ€™s use predates that of cloud computing. Cloud applications allow the cloud to be
					leveraged for software architecture, reducing the burdens of maintenance, support, and operations by having the application run on computers belonging
					to the vendor.
